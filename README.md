Simple calculator made from tkinter. Unfortunately, this code cannot be run in other computers since the custom buttons made from MS paint are generated from absolute filepaths. I've been recommended to use relative filepaths, but still need to research more on how to use it.

The operators include:

  -Addition
  
  -Multiplication
  
  -Subtraction
  
  -Division
  
  -Factorials
  
  -Square roots

  There are also some brackets for ordered operations (BEDMAS) and percentage. There are some constraints for the factorial and square root operators, where they can only be used by themselves and not with other operators. Therefore, 3*sqrt(9) won't give you anything. Same problem for factorials. I will fix this problem in the future. But for now, this is what I have.
